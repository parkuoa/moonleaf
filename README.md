## Manual
---
> [!IMPORTANT]
> After downloading and trying to launch the app, you will receive a text saying that it is from an unidentified developer.
> This is because I do not own an Apple Developer account. To fix this:
> 1. Open **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security**
> 2. Scroll down and find the warning about the app
> 3. Click **Open Anyway**
>
> You only need to do this once.

Petalia is licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE). \
Versions pre-v3.0 (macpaper) are licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3). 

## 🔨 Building from Source
- Clone the repo
- Run ```scripts/build.sh```, optionally with the --all flag to build for all archs (will default to host arch)

## 🉑️ Translating
Contributing to translation is pretty simple and straightforward -partly because there are not many strings to translate-. Fork the repo, grab the template on the [lang](./lang) folder (or an already existing strings file), and replace the value of the keys with the ones respective to your language. Then, upload the translation to lang/{lang}.lproj and submit a pull request.

It is advised that you, alongside the strings file, place a file named `credit` with a link to your GitHub profile, or just your username.

## 🤝 Thanks to

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
### Quarantine
If you suspect the app is quarantined, run the following on your Terminal after dragging the app to Applications:
```bash
xattr -l /Applications/Petalia.app
```
Which shall output ```com.apple.quarantine: ...;{BROWSER};``` if the app IS quarantined.
In that case, run:
```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Petalia.app
```

### Apple could not verify "Petalia" is free of malware...
You can fix this by doing the same steps as [here](https://github.com/parkuoa/moonleaf/tree/main/README.md#installation).
